            Hi I am Ayan. The person who made Generator PromptAI. I made this website because I was fed up with tools being hidden behind things you have to sign up for or ads or subscriptions that cost a lot of money.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generator PromptAI started as a project I worked on in my room in Karachi, Pakistan. I wanted to make something that would be useful for students, people who work on their developers, small business owners and anyone who just needs a tool that is easy to use and does not give them any trouble.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today Generator PromptAI has than 20 tools that you can use for free on the internet. Things like a tool to make images smaller a QR code maker, a PDF changer, a password maker, a JSON fixer and a lot more. Every single tool on Generator PromptAI works in your browser. None of your stuff is sent to any server. Your files and information stay private and safe.
          </p>
